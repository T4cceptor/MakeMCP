# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

MakeMCP is a Go CLI tool that creates MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers from various sources, enabling AI agents to interact with diverse systems through a unified interface. The tool transforms different types of sources into MCP-compatible servers:

- **OpenAPI specifications** - Convert REST APIs into MCP tools (current implementation)
- **CLI tools** - Generate MCP tools from command-line utilities using their --help descriptions (planned)
- **Frameworks** - Create MCP interfaces from framework documentation and code (planned)
- **MCP server proxying** - Centralize control over multiple MCP servers by proxying them (planned)

The current implementation focuses on OpenAPI specifications as a well-defined starting point, but the architecture is designed to support multiple source types through a modular approach.

2. Source-specific parser converts operations/commands into MCP tools with proper schemas
3. Handler functions are generated for each tool to interact with the underlying system
4. MCP server is started with stdio or HTTP transport

## Build and Development

### Makefile Commands
The project includes a comprehensive Makefile with automation for common tasks:

**Primary Commands:**
```bash
# Build the binary (recommended)
make build

# Build and run with help
make run

# Clean build artifacts
make clean

# Run tests
make test

# Full development workflow (clean, format, vet, test, build)
make dev
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
# Format code
make fmt

# Run linter (requires golangci-lint)
make lint

# Run go vet
make vet

make tag-release minor    # minor version bump
make tag-release patch    # patch version bump
```

### Manual Build Commands
```bash
# Build the binary manually
go build -o build/makemcp cmd/makemcp.go

# Run directly
go run cmd/makemcp.go [commands]

# Build with version info
go build -ldflags "-s -w -X main.version=v1.0.0" -o build/makemcp cmd/makemcp.go
```

### Testing the CLI
```bash
# Show help
./build/makemcp --help

# Test OpenAPI integration (config only) - use Makefile command
make local-test

# Manual test of OpenAPI integration
./build/makemcp openapi -s 'http://localhost:8081/openapi.json' -b "http://localhost:8081" --config-only true
```

## Key Architecture Patterns

### MCP Tool Generation
- Each OpenAPI operation becomes an MCP tool
- Tool schemas are extracted from OpenAPI parameters (path, query, header, cookie, body)
- Handler functions route parameters to appropriate HTTP request locations
- Tools include detailed descriptions with parameter examples

### Parameter Handling
- Parameters are grouped by location using `ToolParams` struct
- Path parameters are substituted in URL templates
- Query parameters are URL-encoded for GET/DELETE requests
- Body parameters are JSON-marshaled for POST/PUT requests
- Headers and cookies are set on HTTP requests
- Prefix-based parameter parsing (e.g., `path__id`, `query__limit`, `header__auth`)

### Transport Support
- Stdio transport for direct MCP protocol communication
- HTTP transport for web-based MCP servers
- Configurable port for HTTP servers

## Dependencies

Core libraries:
- `github.com/urfave/cli/v3` - CLI framework
- `github.com/getkin/kin-openapi` - OpenAPI specification parsing
- `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` - MCP protocol implementation

## Configuration

The tool generates `makemcp.json` configuration files that store:
- MCP server metadata (name, version, transport)
- Tool definitions with schemas and handler information
- Source-specific configuration (OpenAPI base URL, spec location, etc.)
- Generated tool schemas and parameter mappings

Configuration files can be:
- Generated with `--config-only` flag
- Loaded and executed with `makemcp load <config-file>`
- Customized for different environments and use cases

## Common Usage Pattern

1. Point tool at OpenAPI specification URL or file
2. Specify base URL for API calls
3. Choose transport (stdio for MCP clients, http for web access)
4. Tool creates MCP server with auto-generated tools for each API endpoint

## Recent Major Improvements (2025-07-21)

### Code Quality and Linting
The project now has comprehensive linting configuration and all critical issues have been resolved:

**Lint Command:**
- `make lint` now passes successfully with comprehensive golangci-lint configuration
- Critical issues fixed: cyclomatic complexity, unused parameters, error handling
- Style issues appropriately ignored via `.golangci.yml` exclude rules
- Compatible with CI/CD pipelines

**Code Improvements:**
- **Reduced Cyclomatic Complexity**: Refactored `GetHandlerFunction` from complexity 17 to ~8 by extracting helper functions:
  - `buildRequestURL()` - URL construction and query parameters
  - `buildRequestBody()` - Request body preparation for non-GET methods  
  - `setRequestHeaders()` - Headers and cookies application
- **Fixed Error Handling**: All `errcheck` violations resolved with proper error checking
- **Removed Dead Code**: Eliminated unused parameters and functions
- **Modern Go Practices**: Updated octal literals (`0644` â†’ `0o644`), improved type safety

### Build System Fixes
**GitHub Actions:**
- Fixed build failures in CI/CD pipeline by correcting Go build paths
- Updated both `ci.yml` and `release.yml` to use `./cmd/makemcp.go` instead of `.`
